phpBB3.1-adblock-detector
=========================

A non-blockable AdBlock detector adapted for use with phpBB3.1.x forum software in conjunction with marttiphpbb custom code extension https://github.com/marttiphpbb/phpbb-ext-customcode (tested with version 0.1.2)

After unzipping and uploading the files, go to the extensions tab in the admin control panel, choose for custom code -> edit -> overall_header_content_before.html and use the following include : <!-- INCLUDE ../../../../../../store/customcode/nero.html -->

That is it, you might want to consider renaming the name nero.html in something else, and change the message.
Do dit only AFTER you have tested it.

Please do not use this scrip to simply annoy people.
It is only ment for those 'I decide what I see on the screen' kind of guys, to get some common sense in them that there is a bill to be paid at the end of eacht month, which they might help paying without even spending a dime...
